# Storymap
This is the repository is an example of a storymap/website. It includes the structure of what will be the new website for my mothers small general store in Logsden Oregon. Previously, I had been hosting her website on Hostgator and had used a wordpress template to design the site. The old website is located here : [Logsden Country Store](www.logsdencountrystore.com)

I will be using this code once I move over the domain to github or set up my own server.
